        "This is a note that records my journey into computer animation. The structure of this note is inspired by the books [\"Physically Based Rendering:From Theory To Implementation\"](https://www.pbr-book.org/), [\"Ray Tracing in One Weekend\"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), and [\"Numerical Tours\"](https://www.numerical-tours.com/). Most books and articles about computer animation and physics simulation are mathematic centric and do not contain much code and experiments. This note is an attempt to bridge the gap."

There will be quite a bit of math -- sorry. The code is going to be all written in numpy and visualize with matplotlib."
