        "This is a note that records my journey into computer animation. The structure of this tour is inspired by the books [\"Physically Based Rendering:From Theory To Implementation\"](https://www.pbr-book.org/), [\"Ray Tracing in One Weekend\"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), and [\"Numerical Tours\"](https://www.numerical-tours.com/). Most books and articles about computer animation and physics simulation are mathematic centric and do not contain much code and experiments. This note is an attempt to bridge the gap."

        "This is the hub to the chapters of this tour. I do not assume background on computer animation or graphics, but I do assume basic familiarity on calculus and linear algebra. There will be quite a bit of math -- sorry. The code is going to be all written in numpy and visualize with matplotlib. These are going to be unoptimized code. We will focus slightly more on the foundation instead of immediate practical implementations, so it might take a while before we can render fancy animations. Don't be afraid to play with the code."
